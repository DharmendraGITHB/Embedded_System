# Power Management

## Overview
Power management is critical in embedded systems to extend battery life and reduce energy consumption.

## Techniques
- **Sleep Modes**: Utilizing various sleep modes to reduce power consumption when the system is idle.
- **Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)**: Adjusting voltage and frequency based on workload to save power.
- **Power Gating**: Turning off power to unused components to reduce overall power consumption.

## Best Practices
- **Optimize Code**: Write efficient code to reduce processing time and power usage.
- **Use Low-Power Components**: Select hardware components designed for low power consumption.
- **Monitor Power Consumption**: Regularly measure and analyze power usage to identify optimization opportunities.
