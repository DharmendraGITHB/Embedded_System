# Microcontrollers vs Microprocessors

## Microcontrollers
Microcontrollers are compact integrated circuits designed to govern specific operations in an embedded system. They typically include a CPU, memory, and I/O peripherals.

### Key Features:
- Integrated peripherals and memory
- Low power consumption
- Used in dedicated applications (e.g., appliances, automotive systems)

## Microprocessors
Microprocessors are the central processing units (CPUs) used in computers. They usually lack integrated memory and peripherals, which are managed separately.

### Key Features:
- Higher processing power
- Separate components for memory and I/O
- Used in general-purpose computing (e.g., PCs, servers)

## Comparison
- **Integration**: Microcontrollers are more integrated, while microprocessors are more flexible but require additional components.
- **Application**: Microcontrollers are used in embedded systems with specific tasks, while microprocessors are used in systems requiring higher processing power.
