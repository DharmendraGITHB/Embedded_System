# Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)

## Overview
A Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) is designed to process data and events within a specific time frame, ensuring timely and predictable responses.

## Types of RTOS
- **Hard RTOS**: Guarantees that critical tasks are completed within a strict deadline.
- **Soft RTOS**: Aims for timely responses but with less stringent deadlines.

## Importance
RTOS is crucial in applications where timing and predictability are essential, such as:
- Automotive systems
- Medical devices
- Industrial automation

## Key Concepts
- **Task Scheduling**: Mechanisms to manage task execution and prioritization.
- **Interrupt Handling**: Managing interrupts to ensure timely responses.
- **Task Synchronization**: Techniques to handle concurrent tasks and avoid conflicts.
