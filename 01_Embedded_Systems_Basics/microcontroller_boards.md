# Types of Microcontroller Boards

There are many types of microcontroller boards available, each designed for different purposes and capabilities. Here's a breakdown of some popular types:

## 1. ESP8266-Based Boards
- **ESP-01**: Basic module with minimal GPIO pins.
- **NodeMCU**: Development board based on ESP8266, easy to use with Lua or Arduino IDE.
- **Wemos D1 Mini**: A smaller version of NodeMCU with similar functionality but more compact.

## 2. ESP32-Based Boards
- **ESP32**: Successor to the ESP8266 with dual-core processing, Bluetooth, and better performance.
- **ESP32 DevKit**: A development board similar to NodeMCU but with the ESP32 chip.
- **ESP32-CAM**: An ESP32 board with a built-in camera, commonly used for image processing applications.

## 3. STM32-Based Boards
- **STM32F103 ("Blue Pill")**: A very popular and low-cost STM32 development board.
- **Nucleo Boards**: Official STMicroelectronics boards for STM32 development, often feature more GPIO and debugging capabilities.
- **Discovery Boards**: Feature-rich development boards with peripherals like LCD displays, sensors, etc., for STM32.

## 4. Arduino-Based Boards
- **Arduino Uno**: One of the most popular development boards for beginners.
- **Arduino Nano**: A smaller version of the Arduino Uno with similar functionality.
- **Arduino Mega**: More GPIO pins and memory, ideal for larger projects.

## 5. Raspberry Pi-Based Boards
- **Raspberry Pi 4**: A full computer in a small form factor, capable of running Linux.
- **Raspberry Pi Pico**: A microcontroller board based on the RP2040 chip, suitable for embedded systems.

## 6. Other Development Boards
- **BeagleBone Black**: Similar to Raspberry Pi, with extensive I/O and suitable for real-time applications.
- **Teensy**: Known for being compact but powerful, often used in performance-sensitive applications.

These boards vary in terms of processing power, memory, connectivity options, and available GPIO pins, making them suited for different types of projects. Which type of board are you considering for your project?
