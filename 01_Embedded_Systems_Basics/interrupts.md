# Interrupts

## Overview
Interrupts are signals that temporarily halt the CPU's current operations to address an urgent task or event. After handling the interrupt, the CPU resumes its previous tasks.

## Types of Interrupts
- **Hardware Interrupts**: Generated by hardware devices (e.g., timers, I/O peripherals).
- **Software Interrupts**: Generated by software instructions (e.g., system calls).

## Interrupt Handling Process
1. **Interrupt Request**: A signal is sent to the CPU indicating an interrupt.
2. **Interrupt Acknowledgment**: The CPU acknowledges the interrupt and saves its state.
3. **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)**: Executes the code to handle the interrupt.
4. **Resume Execution**: The CPU restores its previous state and continues execution.

## Applications
Interrupts are used in various applications, such as:
- Handling input from sensors or user interfaces
- Managing communication protocols (e.g., UART, SPI)
- Scheduling and timing tasks in RTOS
